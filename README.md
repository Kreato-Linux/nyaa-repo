# Kreato Linux official package repository
This is the Kreato Linux package repository. 
You should find the required packages for a nice base system here.

# Goals
* Have enough packages to get a GUI and browse the internet.
* Do it without having nonfree packages on the repository.

# Usage
Run `nyaa u`. This should automatically clone the repository. If it does not, [please file a bug report](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaa/issues).
If for some reason you need to clone it by hand, you can do so aswell.
```
git clone https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaa-repo.git --depth=1 /etc/nyaa
```

# Credits
* Arch Linux packages
* Linux From Scratch packages
* KISS Linux packages.

Please note that this does not mean that the packages are taken from these projects, it just means that the packages have inspirations from these projects' packages aswell.
